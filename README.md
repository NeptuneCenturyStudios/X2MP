# X2MP
<p>
X2MP (X2 Media Player) is a media player built with the FMOD Sound System from Firelight Technologies. 
The player was started several years ago as an experiment with a framework similar to WPF that I was building in C. 
I abandoned the project when I discovered WPF. X2MP is a successor to XMP5 (evolved over several years and written in BCX).

<h4>Reinventing and reviving the project<h4>
<p>
  Development had been halted on X2MP for a few years now, and about a year ago, was pulled from my website. However,
  late last year (2014) I re-added the project as a downloadable in a zip file since I was still recieving a LOT of traffic
  to download it from various other referrals.
</p>
<p>
  Because of this apparent interest, I am brining the project back to life, rewriting it from the ground up in WPF, and using
  the new FMOD Studio API. Also, I decided to make it open source and host on GitHub.
